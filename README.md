## **Key Features**

- **Multi-Tab Structure**: Implemented a tabbed UI with three distinct sections: **Profile**, **Interest**, and **Settings**.
- **Field Validation**:
  - **Age Field**: Numeric values only.
  - **Email Field**: Proper email format validation.
- **UI Elements**: Integrated **Dropdowns**, **Radio Buttons**, and **Checkboxes** for dynamic input.
- **Mandatory Field Validation**: Ensured all required fields were validated before moving to the next tab.
- **Data Persistence**: Preserved form data across tabs, allowing users to move between tabs without losing entered information.
- **Submit Button**: Form submission was only allowed after completing the final tab (**Settings**), ensuring all data was filled out and validated.
